# Today I Learned

A personal knowledge base from a Data Engineer working in Berlin's startup ecosystem. This site is built with [Pelican](https://getpelican.com/) using the [Elegant](https://elegant.oncrashreboot.com/) theme.

## Purpose

As a Data Engineer working with startups in Berlin, I encounter new challenges, tools, and insights daily. This blog serves as my digital garden of knowledge snippets, technical discoveries, and data engineering learnings. By documenting these experiences, I create a searchable archive that helps reinforce my learning and might help other data professionals facing similar challenges.

Topics typically include:
- Data Engineering best practices
- Data Infrastructure and Architecture
- ETL/ELT Pipelines
- Cloud Technologies
- Startup Tech Stack Decisions
- Performance Optimization
- Data Modeling
