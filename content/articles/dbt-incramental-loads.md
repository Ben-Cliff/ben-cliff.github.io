# Optimizing Event Analytics: Incremental Processing Strategies for High-Volume Data

Event tracking is critical for understanding user behavior, but as data volumes grow into the millions of events per day, traditional full-refresh data processing becomes unsustainable. I recently tackled this challenge by implementing specialized incremental loading patterns in DBT and BigQuery for two major event sources.

## Common Challenges and Solutions

Despite their differences, both GA4 and Mixpanel implementations faced several shared challenges:

### Deduplication Requirements:
- Both systems required reliable deduplication mechanisms for incremental processing to work correctly
- Without proper deduplication, incremental merges would fail or produce inaccurate results
- Both implementations needed to generate unique identifiers to track processed records

### Incremental Processing Architecture:
- Both solutions used DBT's incremental materialization with merge strategies
- Both leveraged BigQuery's partitioning and clustering for performance optimization
- Both implemented a 3-day lookback window to handle late-arriving data

### Performance Optimization:
- Both systems dramatically reduced processing time through incremental loading
- Both reduced computational costs by only processing new or changed data
- Both improved query performance through strategic partitioning and clustering

## Key Differences

While sharing common foundations, each implementation addressed unique challenges:

### GA4 Focus:
- Schema evolution handling through table sharding
- User identity resolution for marketing attribution
- Session reconstruction for consistent user journeys

### Mixpanel Focus:
- Managing extremely high data volumes
- Handling duplicate events sent by the source system
- Historical data backfill while maintaining consistency
